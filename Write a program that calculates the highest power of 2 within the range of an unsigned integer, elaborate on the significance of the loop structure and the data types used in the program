// Write a program that calculates the highest power of 2 within the range of an unsigned integer, elaborate on the significance of the loop structure and the data types used in the program.

// The program initializes an unsigned int variable, maxint, with the maximum value representable by an unsigned integer on a typical 32-bit system. It then employs a for loop, iterating through powers of 2 until it reaches or exceeds the value of maxint. The loop increments a counter variable, count, with each iteration, essentially counting the number of times the loop runs.
